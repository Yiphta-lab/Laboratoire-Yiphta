I utilized genetic algorithms, gradient descent, and reinforcement learning to optimize the reconstruction process. For the first time, I developed a Streamlit application that allows me to define a target signal, apply algorithms to capture all its frequencies, and measure their performance. This approach refined my algorithms, significantly increasing the accuracy of acoustic analyses. I've learned a lot!",
